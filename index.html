                <p>
                    Highly Strong intermolecular forces between the molecules, leads to a definite volume in Solids.
                    Solids have a definite shape to them.
                    The intermolecular space between solids is absent.The force of attraction between the molecules is incredibly high
                    vThey are incompressible.

                <p>The intermolecular forces are stronger than gases but weaker than solids.
                    Liquids do not have a definite shape.The intermolecular space is moderate but present.
                    The force of attraction between molecules is pretty moderate.
                    Liquids cannot be compressed.
                    The intermolecular forces are stronger than gases but weaker than solids.

                <p>
                    The intermolecular forces are practically non-existent. Thus, there is no definite volume.
                    Gases do not have a definite shape.The intermolecular space is moderate but present.	
                    The intermolecular space is free-flowing and plenty.
                    There is no intermolecular force of attraction between the molecules.
They are incompressible.	Liquids cannot be compressed.	Gases can be compressed quite easily.
